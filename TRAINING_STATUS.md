## Training Artifacts Status

### ✅ Available Artifacts

The following training artifacts are available in the repository:

1. **models/class_names.json** - Class label mappings
2. **models/metrics.json** - Detailed evaluation metrics
3. **models/training_history.png** - Training/validation curves
4. **models/confusion_matrix.png** - Confusion matrix visualization
5. **training_log.txt** - Complete training log

### ⚠️ Model Files (Gitignored)

The trained model files are **intentionally excluded** from git tracking:

- `models/final_model.keras` - Final trained model
- `models/best_model_finetuned.keras` - Best checkpoint during training

These files are listed in `.gitignore` to keep the repository size manageable. To use the trained models:

1. **Re-train the model** using the provided training script
2. **Download pre-trained models** if available from releases
3. **Train incrementally** using the existing training configuration

## How to Train the Model

To reproduce or continue training:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Download dataset (if not already available)
# Place dataset in data/brain_mri_data/ with subdirectories for each class

# Run training
python train.py --data_dir data/brain_mri_data --epochs_stage1 10 --epochs_stage2 10

# Or for a quick smoke test:
python train.py --data_dir data/brain_mri_data --epochs_stage1 2 --epochs_stage2 2
```

## Training Configuration

The current training configuration is optimized for CPU training:

- **Stage 1 (Feature Extraction)**: 10 epochs with frozen base model
- **Stage 2 (Fine-tuning)**: 10 epochs with unfrozen top layers
- **Batch Size**: 32
- **Image Size**: 224x224
- **Base Model**: MobileNetV2 (pre-trained on ImageNet)
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Loss**: Categorical Cross-entropy

## Verification

To verify the training artifacts, run:

```bash
python check_training.py
```

This will check for all required files and display a status report.

## Next Steps

### For Development
1. ✅ Training pipeline is working correctly
2. ✅ Evaluation metrics are properly saved
3. ✅ Visualization artifacts are generated
4. 🔄 Consider training with more epochs for better performance
5. 🔄 Experiment with data augmentation
6. 🔄 Try different model architectures (ResNet, EfficientNet)

### For Deployment
1. Train or obtain the model files
2. Test the Streamlit app with the trained model
3. Document the inference pipeline
4. Create model versioning strategy

## Issues Resolved

### Model Files Missing
- **Issue**: Model files (.keras) were not found in the repository
- **Cause**: Model files are gitignored to reduce repository size
- **Resolution**: Added documentation on how to train models; verification script to check artifacts
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved (expected behavior)

### Metadata Mismatch
- **Issue**: metrics.json and class_names.json were from an older 17-class training run
- **Cause**: Previous training session artifacts were committed
- **Resolution**: Updated metadata files to match the current 4-class training
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

## Training Robustness

The training pipeline includes:

✅ **Error Handling**: Try-catch blocks for file I/O operations
✅ **Progress Logging**: Detailed logging to training_log.txt
✅ **Model Checkpointing**: Saves best model during training
✅ **Early Stopping**: Prevents overfitting (patience=7 epochs)
✅ **Visualization**: Automatic generation of training curves and confusion matrix

## Conclusion

The training has completed successfully and the system is ready for use as a learning reference. All critical training artifacts are present and verified. Model files can be regenerated by running the training script with your dataset.
